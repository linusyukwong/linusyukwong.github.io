I am a fifth-year ESE PhD student at [UPenn](https://www.ese.upenn.edu), advised by Prof. Jing Li. Before Penn, I completed my Masters at [HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk) and my undergrad at [CUHK](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk).

My research interests are in the intersection of hardware security, high-performance networking, storage, and accelerators. I am currently working on optimized hardware for propagating and checking software-programmable metadata (e.g. Tagged Architectures and Pointer Authentication).
